      <hr>
      <p>My name is Ebenezer Olafimihan, I was born on the 16<sup>th</sup> of October and i grew up in Lagos Nigeria. I had my basic education back in Nigeria and graduated from The University of Ibadan with  Bachelos degree in Geography
      My hobbies are photography, gaming an cooking. Sometimes i enjoy evening walks arround the park. I move to Canada last year out of my aspiration to get a view of life from another side of the world.
    I currently live in ottawa and amongst the many things i enjoy very much about the city is the scenery and the efficient transport system. I look forward visiting other cities next summer.
  </p>
      <p>My career aspiration is to provide solutions by building user friendly products. I am currently studying Interactive Media Design <abr title= "Interactive Media Design"> IMD </abr> at <em>Algonquin College</em> and i aspire to be a proficient User Experience designer at the end of my program.
        The choice of Algonquin College for this program for me is basically because of its rich content and hands-on learning structure which i was told the college is reputable for.
        So far I have enjoyed all the classes till date and met amazing professors and teachers and more importantly i aspire to bring the knowlege and experience with me in my quest to create cool apps and websites.
