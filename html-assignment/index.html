      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>My name is Ebenezer Olafimihan, I was born on the 16<sup>th</sup> of October and i grew up in Lagos Nigeria. I had my basic education back in Nigeria and graduated from The University of Ibadan with Bachelors degree in Geography.
      My hobbies are photography, gaming and cooking. Sometimes, I enjoy evening walks arround the park. I moved to Canada last year out of my aspiration to get a view of life from another side of the world.
    I currently live in ottawa and amongst the many things i enjoy very much about the city is the scenery and the efficient transport system. I look forward to visiting other cities next summer.
  </p>
      <p>My career aspiration is to provide solutions by building user friendly products. I am currently studying Interactive Media Design, <abr title= "Interactive Media Design"> IMD </abr> at <strong>Algonquin College</strong> and I aspire to be a proficient <abr title= "User Experience">UX</abr> designer at the end of my program.
        My choice of Algonquin College for this program basically stems from the colleges reputation and the hands-on learning structure which I was told the college is known for.
        So far, I have enjoyed all the classes till date, and met amazing professors and teachers. More importantly, I aspire to bring the knowledge and experience with me in my quest to create cool apps and websites.
