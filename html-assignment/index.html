      My hobbies are photography, gaming an cooking. Sometimes i enjoy evening walks arround the park. I move to Canada last year out of my aspiration to get a view of life from another side of the world.
    I currently live in ottawa and amongst the many things i enjoy very much about the city is the scenery and the efficient transport system. I look forward visiting other cities next summer.</p>
